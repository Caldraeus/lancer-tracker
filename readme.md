# Lancer Tracker
This is a second monitor style JRPG initiative tracker for the Lancer TTRPG. This was originally created for a school project but I decided to continue work on it due to the fact that I play Lancer often and wish to use this.

And man, I mean, what a nightmare this was to make! I had never, ever, touched we development before. I honestly still barely understand how this works for some parts. A lot of it stems from the node website architecture and how to actually build around that. But hey, we got there.
